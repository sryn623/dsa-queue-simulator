## 🌟 Overview  
This project is a dynamic simulation of a traffic junction management system, built with queue data structures in C++ and visualized using SDL3. Designed for the COMP202 assignment, it’s a blend of algorithmic precision and graphical flair—think vehicles, lights, and lanes, all working in sync.

## ✨ Features  
- 🚗 **Real-Time Traffic**: Simulates vehicle flow with queue-based logic.  
- 🛤️ **Priority Lanes**: Handles high-priority traffic (AL2) with finesse.  
- ⚡ **Mode Switching**: Flip between normal and high-priority operations.  
- 📊 **Visualization**: See queues and lights in action via SDL3 graphics.  
- ⏱️ **Light Synchronization**: Traffic lights align perfectly with queue states.  
- 📡 **File-Based IPC**: Enables inter-process communication under the hood.
